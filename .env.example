# WordPress Multi-Site Configuration
#
# Configure multiple WordPress sites using the pattern:
# SITE_<NAME>_URL, SITE_<NAME>_USER, SITE_<NAME>_APP_PASSWORD
#
# The <NAME> can be anything (alphanumeric, underscores), and will be used
# to reference the site in MCP tools. It will be converted to lowercase.
#
# How to generate WordPress Application Passwords:
# 1. Log into WordPress admin
# 2. Go to Users â†’ Your Profile
# 3. Scroll to "Application Passwords"
# 4. Enter a name and click "Add New Application Password"
# 5. Copy the generated password (spaces included)

# Example Site 1: GoogleRank
SITE_GOOGLERANK_URL=https://googlerank.com.au
SITE_GOOGLERANK_USER=goto@digifix.com.au
SITE_GOOGLERANK_APP_PASSWORD=iUGn XOkL QPvs q6jv CCI1 xWAd

# Example Site 2: Another site
# SITE_MYSITE_URL=https://mysite.com
# SITE_MYSITE_USER=admin@mysite.com
# SITE_MYSITE_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

# Example Site 3: Development site
# SITE_DEV_URL=https://dev.example.com
# SITE_DEV_USER=developer@example.com
# SITE_DEV_APP_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

# Add as many sites as needed following the same pattern
# Each site name must be unique

# Notes:
# - The URL should be the base WordPress URL (without /wp-json)
# - Application passwords can include spaces
# - Site names are case-insensitive (GOOGLERANK becomes googlerank)
